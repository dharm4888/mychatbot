    "text": "there has been a lot of hype around model context protocol and I'm going to make  \nan attempt to provide an extremely simple explanation of mCP today I will also \ngo into technical details so that if you are building an AI application it helps  \nyou if you think about a of building a applications we are seeing a clear \nEvolution first we started with llm without any tools Etc then we started \nbuilding this agentic Frameworks ET where llm gets help from tools and knowledge  \nnow we are entering the realm of standardized ways of interacting with these \ntools and knowledge so that building AI applications becomes easier let me give \nyou an example say you are a equity research analyst working at some company \nlet's say jeffre you want to develop a report comparing Nvidia and Tesla stock \nthat looks something like this where you have company description at the the \nbeginning then you have some uh Financial metrics then you have a summary of \nthose metrics and in the end you have recent news about those companies now you \nare a tax heavy person so you will talk to your AI engineer friend working at \nJeff and you will ask him to uh build an a application that can automatically \ngenerate this report now your AI engineer friends understands the capability of \nllm see they know that llm can pull the description of Nvidia and Tesla because \nit is part of that training data set but it cannot pull the latest stock price \nfor example once you have somehow retrieved let's say the latest stock price llm  \ncan summarize uh that particular information okay so if you think about pure llm  \nit has all these capabilities now you'll ask me okay if I go go to chat GPT and \nif I type this question it is pulling the information but look at this it is \nsearching the web actually so chat GPT is an agent I am referring to GPT 40 \nmodel okay so now you already know the answer that you can use web search or \nmaybe you can uh call Yahoo finance API which is called a tool to retrieve the \nlatest information to summarize AI engineer will build this application where \nthe heart is llm and llm is interacting with some tools which can be Yahoo \nfinance API or web search it is also interacting with some knowledge you might \nhave some private database in Jeff some PDF files lmm might want to pull data \nfrom it and he will write all this glue code okay glue code is basically the \ncode that you're writing for these interactions now this can be an agentic \napplication in which glue code is written by the agentic framework such as crew \nAI egno Etc or it can be a workflow application where as part of your python \ncode you writing all this glue code this is just one application imagine jeffre \nis building 20 such application and think about all the companies in the world \nbuilding millions of applications that is a lot of glue code it sounds like you \nhave this old computer and you're connecting with keyboard mouse Etc through all  \nthese different wires but you will be like no today things have changed today \nyou can connect computer using this unified interface USB C Port you can have \nyour USB hub and you can connect all this devices well that USBC moment has \narrived for AI and that is your model context protocol in this your llm will \ninteract through model context protocol with different mCP servers so for our \nJeff example think that Yahoo finance is building an mCP server or let's say \nGoogle search is building another mCP server where they're exposing all these \ntools and resources and prompts Etc and that way these interactions becomes \neasier now you're a smart programmer and you'll be like hey we are still writing  \ngluc code right because you need to do all these interactions the answer is yes \nyou are writing some glue code here but the AE of writing that code is \nincreasing going back to our old diagram the problem here was not just writing \nthe code but maintaining it because tomorrow if Yahoo finance changes their API \nyou have to maintain this code right so all this glue code becomes a nightmare \nto maintain whereas with this mCP due to the standard protocol writing and \nmaintaining the code has become easier and also since writing this code is \ncentralized let's say Yahoo finance folks will write their mCP server so now all  \nthese 10,000 programmers in the world they don't have to write the code okay so \nthey are kind of getting this redimed thing and they are saving time on building  \ntheir AI applications let's go deeper into technical details now say you are \nbuilding this chatboard for your organization which requires interacting with \nGoogle Maps API so let's say you're getting some location and you are \nautomatically creating the to-do task using this app todoist and the technical \nteams at Google Maps and todoist have already built these mCP servers in mCP \nclient which is your chatboard you will have a configuration which will tell you  \nwhat kind of servers are available to this client when this chatboard starts at \nthe beginning let's say just think about Google Maps server it will make a call \ncalled list tools and this call will be made for Google Maps to doist all the \nservers which are listed Google Maps mCP server will return all its capabilities  \nin form of this type of response so here you are saying that I can help you \nsearch places and you are providing this detailed description this description \nis very important because it will guide llm to uh call an appropriate tool llm \nhas language intelligence so just by reading this description it can figure out \nthat for whatever query if I have to search places I can use this map search \nplaces tool not only that from the query it will also extract the required \nparameters such as search query latitude longitude Etc let's say you are going \nfor a hiking in lak and you'll say I'm going from lak to this place um you know \nshow me the places is so from that natural question it will extract the \nparameter lak is a location and it will map it to Lang uh longitude and latitude  \nand it will also uh determine that it needs to call this function now you will \nhave all the tools you will have map place details and all the functionalities \nthat Google Maps provides not only that you will have the tool description from \nother servers such as todoist as well so so once uh llm knows all these details \nnow let's say you are asking this question that I'm going for hiking in lak and \nI need this place details what uh this application my chatboard will do is it \nwill use this kind of a prompt so in this prompt this tool description is \nnothing but the combine tool description of all the tools you have available \nokay and it will say that choose the appropriate tool based on the user question  \nso when you have tool description and this kind of nice prompt llm is smart \nenough to figure out which tool to call which parameter to extract from the user  \nquestion and how to make a call get the response and how to read the response \nand serve to the end user here I have this uh mCP client from the python SDK \nthat anthropic has provided when it starts it will go through all the servers \nremember that server configuration it will go through all the servers and each \nserver it will ask list tools and whatever tools it is getting it will get the \ndescription of all those tools and it will put it here and look at this prompt \nokay so now you understand that llm is getting a question how it Maps or how it \nfigure out an appropriate tool to call now let me show you the mCP server from \nGoogle Maps here it is listing the tools so when mCP client makes that request \nit will handle that request and it will list all the tools so you see this call \nokay and what are the tools so let's search for all the tools okay so search \nplaces tool you see search places tool geoc code tool okay so search places tool  \nshould be here So eventually it will come to this python function oh this is not  \npython actually this is typescript so you can Implement your server in either \ntypescript or Python and here from the user question it will derive the query \nlocation Etc and it will actually make an HTTP call to the Google Map API so \nit's not like you are replacing uh a rest protocol here or HTTP it's like a \nrapper and you are internally calling Google Map API and you are returning the \nresponse in a standardized format okay so there is a standard here so if you \nlook at uh the input schema okay so let me search for input schema see input \nschema you see so for the search places tool you see here there is a standard \nway you will uh provide the description of the tool and also the query parameter  \nEtc so see this input schema description Etc is part of this particular standard  \nso you can find the this schema I'm going to provide all the links okay so this \nis the standard this is the schema that anybody who is building an mCP server \nwill have to add her to so that way we have standard and some uh uniform or \npredictable way of communication okay so you look at this types script schema \nwhere you say input schema is this type required whatever just go through this \nschema and you will get an idea any mCP server will expose three capabilities \ntool resource and prompt their python SDK has simple examples for each of them \nso let's look at the tool this is a simple server with one single tool okay so \nif you look at the list tools function see list tool tools here it is exposing \nsee this is an array okay so it is exposing a single tool called fatch and there  \nis this standard description standard input schema and so on if you look at the \nimplementation of fat it looks like this okay so you are fetching a website okay  \nso here see you are fetching a website so whenever that fatch tool is called you  \ncall this function and you are just retrieving some information by making an \nHTTP call okay so this is pretty straightforward the second capability is a \nresource resource is um some kind of knowledge okay database files Etc and \nsimilar to list tool functions it will have list resources so when the mCP \nclient starts it will call list tools list resources list prompts for each of \nthe servers so it knows the full capabilities of all the servers that it has \navailable or has access to so in the list resources you can have a file see this  \nis a plain file very simple example you can have a file in your uh some drive or  \nsome you know like Amazon S3 Etc you can also have a prompt so just imagine you \nare building mCP server for Yahoo finance as a developer you know all the \nprompts that AI Engineers uh might need to interact with my API okay so you will  \nprovide all those prompts VI your server so writing prompts become very easy for  \nthe mCP client okay so here you are providing one single prompt so once again \nyou have list prompts you are providing all the prompts see this is an array and  \nthis is the simple prompt that takes context and topic and if you look at the \nImp mentation it's pretty simple you have context you have topic and you are \ncreating the prompt using that context and topic folks that's it so that is what  \nis model context protocol I'm going to provide documentation Etc so you can read  \nthrough more details there has been a lot of hype but I believe we are in early \ndays this has a lot of potential but how this is going to evolve and how this is  \ngoing to help AI Engineers solve the real problems is something that we will \nknow as time goes okay so some people are super excited well I'm excited too but  \njust understand that we are in early days there has been lot of hype there is \nsome reality we'll have to see how this thing evolves we are going to come up \nwith few more technical tutorials uh on this so I'll be building some actual \nservers and clients using mCP if you have have any question please post in the \ncomment box below thank you for watching"

providing one single prompt so once again \nyou have list prompts you are providing all the prompts see this is an array and  \nthis is the simple prompt that takes context and topic and if you look at the \nImp mentation it's pretty simple you have context you have topic and you are \ncreating the prompt using that context and topic folks that's it so that is what  \nis model context protocol I'm going to provide documentation Etc so you can read  \nthrough more details there has been a lot of hype but I believe we are in early \ndays this has a lot of potential but how this is going to evolve and how this is  \ngoing to help AI Engineers solve the real problems is something that we will \nknow as time goes okay so some people are super excited well I'm excited too but  \njust understand that we are in early days there has been lot of hype there is \nsome reality we'll have to see how this thing evolves we are going to come up \nwith few more technical tutorials uh on this so I'll be building some actual \nservers and clients using mCP if you have have any question please post in the \ncomment box below thank you for watching"

    "text": "there has been a lot of hype around model context protocol and I'm going to make  \nan attempt to provide an extremely simple explanation of mCP today I will also \ngo into technical details so that if you are building an AI application it helps  \nyou if you think about a of building a applications we are seeing a clear \nEvolution first we started with llm without any tools Etc then we started \nbuilding this agentic Frameworks ET where llm gets help from tools and knowledge  \nnow we are entering the realm of standardized ways of interacting with these \ntools and knowledge so that building AI applications becomes easier let me give \nyou an example say you are a equity research analyst working at some company \nlet's say jeffre you want to develop a report comparing Nvidia and Tesla stock \nthat looks something like this where you have company description at the the \nbeginning then you have some uh Financial metrics then you have a summary of \nthose metrics and in the end you have recent news about those companies now you \nare a tax heavy person so you will talk to your AI engineer friend working at \nJeff and you will ask him to uh build an a application that can automatically \ngenerate this report now your AI engineer friends understands the capability of \nllm see they know that llm can pull the description of Nvidia and Tesla because \nit is part of that training data set but it cannot pull the latest stock price \nfor example once you have somehow retrieved let's say the latest stock price llm  \ncan summarize uh that particular information okay so if you think about pure llm  \nit has all these capabilities now you'll ask me okay if I go go to chat GPT and \nif I type this question it is pulling the information but look at this it is \nsearching the web actually so chat GPT is an agent I am referring to GPT 40 \nmodel okay so now you already know the answer that you can use web search or \nmaybe you can uh call Yahoo finance API which is called a tool to retrieve the \nlatest information to summarize AI engineer will build this application where \nthe heart is llm and llm is interacting with some tools which can be Yahoo \nfinance API or web search it is also interacting with some knowledge you might \nhave some private database in Jeff some PDF files lmm might want to pull data \nfrom it and he will write all this glue code okay glue code is basically the \ncode that you're writing for these interactions now this can be an agentic \napplication in which glue code is written by the agentic framework such as crew \nAI egno Etc or it can be a workflow application where as part of your python \ncode you writing all this glue code this is just one application imagine jeffre \nis building 20 such application and think about all the companies in the world \nbuilding millions of applications that is a lot of glue code it sounds like you \nhave this old computer and you're connecting with keyboard mouse Etc through all  \nthese different wires but you will be like no today things have changed today \nyou can connect computer using this unified interface USB C Port you can have \nyour USB hub and you can connect all this devices well that USBC moment has \narrived for AI and that is your model context protocol in this your llm will \ninteract through model context protocol with different mCP servers so for our \nJeff example think that Yahoo finance is building an mCP server or let's say \nGoogle search is building another mCP server where they're exposing all these \ntools and resources and prompts Etc and that way these interactions becomes \neasier now you're a smart programmer and you'll be like hey we are still writing  \ngluc code right because you need to do all these interactions the answer is yes \nyou are writing some glue code here but the AE of writing that code is \nincreasing going back to our old diagram the problem here was not just writing \nthe code but maintaining it because tomorrow if Yahoo finance changes their API \nyou have to maintain this code right so all this glue code becomes a nightmare \nto maintain whereas with this mCP due to the standard protocol writing and \nmaintaining the code has become easier and also since writing this code is \ncentralized let's say Yahoo finance folks will write their mCP server so now all  \nthese 10,000 programmers in the world they don't have to write the code okay so \nthey are kind of getting this redimed thing and they are saving time on building  \ntheir AI applications let's go deeper into technical details now say you are \nbuilding this chatboard for your organization which requires interacting with \nGoogle Maps API so let's say you're getting some location and you are \nautomatically creating the to-do task using this app todoist and the technical \nteams at Google Maps and todoist have already built these mCP servers in mCP \nclient which is your chatboard you will have a configuration which will tell you  \nwhat kind of servers are available to this client when this chatboard starts at \nthe beginning let's say just think about Google Maps server it will make a call \ncalled list tools and this call will be made for Google Maps to doist all the \nservers which are listed Google Maps mCP server will return all its capabilities  \nin form of this type of response so here you are saying that I can help you \nsearch places and you are providing this detailed description this description \nis very important because it will guide llm to uh call an appropriate tool llm \nhas language intelligence so just by reading this description it can figure out \nthat for whatever query if I have to search places I can use this map search \nplaces tool not only that from the query it will also extract the required \nparameters such as search query latitude longitude Etc let's say you are going \nfor a hiking in lak and you'll say I'm going from lak to this place um you know \nshow me the places is so from that natural question it will extract the \nparameter lak is a location and it will map it to Lang uh longitude and latitude  \nand it will also uh determine that it needs to call this function now you will \nhave all the tools you will have map place details and all the functionalities \nthat Google Maps provides not only that you will have the tool description from \nother servers such as todoist as well so so once uh llm knows all these details \nnow let's say you are asking this question that I'm going for hiking in lak and \nI need this place details what uh this application my chatboard will do is it \nwill use this kind of a prompt so in this prompt this tool description is \nnothing but the combine tool description of all the tools you have available \nokay and it will say that choose the appropriate tool based on the user question  \nso when you have tool description and this kind of nice prompt llm is smart \nenough to figure out which tool to call which parameter to extract from the user  \nquestion and how to make a call get the response and how to read the response \nand serve to the end user here I have this uh mCP client from the python SDK \nthat anthropic has provided when it starts it will go through all the servers \nremember that server configuration it will go through all the servers and each \nserver it will ask list tools and whatever tools it is getting it will get the \ndescription of all those tools and it will put it here and look at this prompt \nokay so now you understand that llm is getting a question how it Maps or how it \nfigure out an appropriate tool to call now let me show you the mCP server from \nGoogle Maps here it is listing the tools so when mCP client makes that request \nit will handle that request and it will list all the tools so you see this call \nokay and what are the tools so let's search for all the tools okay so search \nplaces tool you see search places tool geoc code tool okay so search places tool  \nshould be here So eventually it will come to this python function oh this is not  \npython actually this is typescript so you can Implement your server in either \ntypescript or Python and here from the user question it will derive the query \nlocation Etc and it will actually make an HTTP call to the Google Map API so \nit's not like you are replacing uh a rest protocol here or HTTP it's like a \nrapper and you are internally calling Google Map API and you are returning the \nresponse in a standardized format okay so there is a standard here so if you \nlook at uh the input schema okay so let me search for input schema see input \nschema you see so for the search places tool you see here there is a standard \nway you will uh provide the description of the tool and also the query parameter  \nEtc so see this input schema description Etc is part of this particular standard  \nso you can find the this schema I'm going to provide all the links okay so this \nis the standard this is the schema that anybody who is building an mCP server \nwill have to add her to so that way we have standard and some uh uniform or \npredictable way of communication okay so you look at this types script schema \nwhere you say input schema is this type required whatever just go through this \nschema and you will get an idea any mCP server will expose three capabilities \ntool resource and prompt their python SDK has simple examples for each of them \nso let's look at the tool this is a simple server with one single tool okay so \nif you look at the list tools function see list tool tools here it is exposing \nsee this is an array okay so it is exposing a single tool called fatch and there  \nis this standard description standard input schema and so on if you look at the \nimplementation of fat it looks like this okay so you are fetching a website okay  \nso here see you are fetching a website so whenever that fatch tool is called you  \ncall this function and you are just retrieving some information by making an \nHTTP call okay so this is pretty straightforward the second capability is a \nresource resource is um some kind of knowledge okay database files Etc and \nsimilar to list tool functions it will have list resources so when the mCP \nclient starts it will call list tools list resources list prompts for each of \nthe servers so it knows the full capabilities of all the servers that it has \navailable or has access to so in the list resources you can have a file see this  \nis a plain file very simple example you can have a file in your uh some drive or  \nsome you know like Amazon S3 Etc you can also have a prompt so just imagine you \nare building mCP server for Yahoo finance as a developer you know all the \nprompts that AI Engineers uh might need to interact with my API okay so you will  \nprovide all those prompts VI your server so writing prompts become very easy for  \nthe mCP client okay so here you are

You may see error messages when using these func-\ntions. Here are some examples:\n•When open one saved PM report which contains one rolled-back counter, you may see error mes-\nsage.\n•In NetAct Monitor, the managed object with a rolled-back icon may be shown as the default icon.\n•If the metadata of one dedicate network element release is rolled back, all the integrated instances\nof that network element release may do not work.\n•After rolling back a new network element release and adaptations are removed, the details of the\nadaptation ID and adaptation release might be seen in Monitoring tools. Alarm upload, element\nmanagement launches, icons, and some other functions are not supported for the objects which\nare created and used by the removed adaptations.\nTo solve these issues, reinstall the corresponding NetAct fast pass service package  with the correct\nnetwork element release, and then upgrade the network element integration. After that, set the net-\nwork element instance in correct status.\nIf you plan to roll back, follow the rollback guidance:\n1.When you decide to roll back the installed NetAct fast pass service package , the rollback must be\nexecuted before the following actions:\n•Upgrade "

The integration mal-\nfunction of the network element is the expected result, because the new network element re-\nlease adaptations are removed. To recover the network element integrations, you need to re-\ninstall the fast pass service package or downgrade the network elements to the previous re-\nlease.\n3.There might be rollback dependencies between different FIT-based NetAct fast pass service pack-\nages.
